# 📍🚗 DFIR Mobile Geolocation & Vehicles Data: Intelligence & Investigation Guide

## 📝 Overview

This repository contains **two distinct papers** that provide comprehensive intelligence frameworks:

- **Mobile Geolocation Tracking & Exploitation:**  
  A guide detailing how mobile devices generate geolocation data through GPS, cell towers, Wi‑Fi, Bluetooth, and app‑based tracking; who collects and uses this data; and how to exploit it for investigative, surveillance, and intelligence operations.

- **Connected Vehicle Data Intelligence:**  
  A framework explaining how modern vehicles generate and transmit data via GPS, telematics, infotainment systems, event data recorders, and biometric sensors; who controls and uses this data; and how it can be leveraged for tracking, forensic analysis, and strategic intelligence.

This repository is designed for investigators, intelligence analysts, and law enforcement agencies seeking to enhance their understanding of how **mobile** and **vehicle** data can be analyzed, exploited, and cross‑referenced for operational intelligence.
