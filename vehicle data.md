## 🔎 1. How Connected Vehicles Generate Data

Connected vehicles continuously transmit, process, and store data from multiple sources:

### 📡 Wireless Connectivity
- __Cellular Networks (V2X/DSRC):__ Enables communication between vehicles and infrastructure (V2I) and other vehicles (V2V).
- __Wi-Fi & Bluetooth:__ Syncs with external devices, infotainment systems, and diagnostics tools.
- __Satellite/GPS:__ Tracks real-time location, speed, and navigation data.
- __Short-Range Radio & Radar:__ Detects nearby objects, aiding in collision avoidance.

### 📊 Vehicle System Data
- __Event Data Recorders (EDR/Black Box):__ Captures crash data, speed, and impact force.
- __Electronic Control Units (ECU/TCU):__ Manages vehicle diagnostics and communication.
- __On-Board Diagnostics (OBD-II):__ Provides telemetry data and real-time engine parameters.

### 🔍 Biometric & Behavioral Data
- __Cabin Monitoring Systems:__ Tracks eye movement, fatigue levels, and seatbelt use.
- __Touch Sensors & Pulse Detection:__ Measures grip strength and heart rate.
- __Microphones & Voice Assistants:__ Records voice commands, phone calls, and ambient conversations.
