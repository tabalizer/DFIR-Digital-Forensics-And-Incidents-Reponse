## 🔎 **1. How Connected Vehicles Generate Data**  

Connected vehicles continuously transmit, process, and store data from multiple sources:  

📡 **Wireless Connectivity**  
- **Cellular Networks (V2X/DSRC)** – Enables communication between vehicles and infrastructure (V2I) and other vehicles (V2V).  
- **Wi-Fi & Bluetooth** – Syncs with external devices, infotainment systems, and diagnostics tools.  
- **Satellite/GPS** – Tracks real-time location, speed, and navigation data.  
- **Short-Range Radio & Radar** – Detects nearby objects, aiding in collision avoidance.  

📊 **Vehicle System Data**  
- **Event Data Recorders (EDR/Black Box)** – Captures crash data, speed, and impact force.  
- **Electronic Control Units (ECU/TCU)** – Manages vehicle diagnostics and communication.  
- **On-Board Diagnostics (OBD-II)** – Provides telemetry data and real-time engine parameters.  

🔍 **Biometric & Behavioral Data**
