## 🔎 1. How Connected Vehicles Generate Data

Connected vehicles continuously transmit, process, and store data from multiple sources:

### 📡 Wireless Connectivity
- <strong>Cellular Networks (V2X/DSRC):</strong> Enables communication between vehicles and infrastructure (V2I) and other vehicles (V2V).
- <strong>Wi-Fi &amp; Bluetooth:</strong> Syncs with external devices, infotainment systems, and diagnostics tools.
- <strong>Satellite/GPS:</strong> Tracks real-time location, speed, and navigation data.
- <strong>Short-Range Radio &amp; Radar:</strong> Detects nearby objects, aiding in collision avoidance.

### 📊 Vehicle System Data
- <strong>Event Data Recorders (EDR/Black Box):</strong> Captures crash data, speed, and impact force.
- <strong>Electronic Control Units (ECU/TCU):</strong> Manages vehicle diagnostics and communication.
- <strong>On-Board Diagnostics (OBD-II):</strong> Provides telemetry data and real-time engine parameters.

### 🔍 Biometric &amp; Behavioral Data
- <strong>Cabin Monitoring Systems:</strong> Tracks eye movement, fatigue levels, and seatbelt use.
- <strong>Touch Sensors &amp; Pulse Detection:</strong> Measures grip strength and heart rate.
- <strong>Microphones &amp; Voice Assistants:</strong> Records voice commands, phone calls, and ambient conversations.
