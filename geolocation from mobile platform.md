## 🔎 1. How Connected Vehicles Generate Data

Connected vehicles continuously transmit, process, and store data from multiple sources:

### 📡 Wireless Connectivity
- **Cellular Networks (V2X/DSRC):** Enables communication between vehicles and infrastructure (V2I) and other vehicles (V2V).
- **Wi-Fi & Bluetooth:** Syncs with external devices, infotainment systems, and diagnostics tools.
- **Satellite/GPS:** Tracks real-time location, speed, and navigation data.
- **Short-Range Radio & Radar:** Detects nearby objects, aiding in collision avoidance.

### 📊 Vehicle System Data
- **Event Data Recorders (EDR/Black Box):** Captures crash data, speed, and impact force.
- **Electronic Control Units (ECU/TCU):** Manages vehicle diagnostics and communication.
- **On-Board Diagnostics (OBD-II):** Provides telemetry data and real-time engine parameters.

### 🔍 Biometric & Behavioral Data
- **Cabin Monitoring Systems:** Tracks eye movement, fatigue levels, and seatbelt use.
- **Touch Sensors & Pulse Detection:** Measures grip strength and heart rate.
- **Microphones & Voice Assistants:** Records voice commands, phone calls, and ambient conversations.
