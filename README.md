# 📍🚗🏠 Mobile Geolocation, Vehicles Data & Smart Home IoT Devices: Intelligence & Investigation Guide

## 📝 Overview

This repository contains **three distinct papers** that provide comprehensive intelligence frameworks:

- **Mobile Geolocation Tracking & Exploitation:**  
  A guide detailing how mobile devices generate geolocation data via GPS, cell towers, Wi‑Fi, Bluetooth, and app‑based tracking; who collects and uses this data; and how it can be exploited for investigative, surveillance, and intelligence operations.

- **Connected Vehicle Data Intelligence:**  
  A framework explaining how modern vehicles generate and transmit data via GPS, telematics, infotainment systems, event data recorders, and biometric sensors; who controls and uses this data; and how it can be leveraged for tracking, forensic analysis, and strategic intelligence.

- **Smart Home IoT Devices Intelligence:**  
  A document outlining how smart home devices generate and transmit data through Wi‑Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, and other connectivity methods; the types of sensor data they collect (environmental, motion, security, etc.); who collects and uses this data; and how it can be analyzed for forensic, operational, and behavioral intelligence.

This repository is designed for investigators, intelligence analysts, and law enforcement agencies seeking to enhance their understanding of how **mobile devices, vehicles, and smart homes** generate data—and how this data can be analyzed, exploited, and cross‑referenced for operational intelligence.
